Since this original has a BSD-style license, I think it is not more than
fair that all my personal additions to this repository are also BSD-licensed.

There are a few things one should be aware off:
 - Some snippets may come from CC-licensed sources (e.g. WikiMedia, StackOverflow).
   Obviously, the respective snippets are always indicated with a link and 
   retain licensed under the terms of the respective CreativeCommons license.
 - The personal information contained within this repository may **only**
   be used for contacting me in the context of job offers, collaboration, ...
 - It is **explicitly disallowed** to use this information for unsolicited 
   advertisement purposes (spam mail, tele-marketing, ...).
